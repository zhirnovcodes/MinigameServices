In order to add a new minigame to the game:

1 - Add its ID to enum Minigames

2 - Open Tools - Minigames - Create

3 - Enter data and click Create

4 - a new scene will be created in the folder Content/Remote/Minigames/{ID}. 

5 - Please add minigame model to the scene manually (it should be in the Scripts folder) - {ID}MinigameModel

Working with Minigames

6 - You can run each minigame scene from its own scene (TestRunner objbect will do it) - you just need to run the scene and press S - it will load the scene and start

7 - Name and Description can be changed in Content/Local/Configs/

8 - For a newly created minigame you can use services (IMinigameServices)

9 - IGameObjectPool - Pools objects from Local content folder. Uses enums for file identification. Enum structure mimics content path

10 - IMinigameGameObjectPool - Pool for minigame folder content only. 

11 - IMinigamesConfigLoader - loads configs only from minigame's folder

Known issues

12 - Cannot automatically add MinigameModel component through editor Scripts

13 - Some objects might be created after MetaUI Dispose 

14 - Second game (memory) is very poor in graphics. 1st one is way better.
